Rejoice, for now the Sentient Pants are among us...

# Sentient Pants
Adds the Sentient Pants enchantment (originally from Enchancement Unbound, now a separate mod) to Minecraft!

Enchantment:
- Sentience (For The Pants) : Leggings enchantment, idea by @eightsidedsquare on Discord. Right-click the leggings or take damage while wearing the leggings to spawn Sentient Pants. This action will consume the leggings.

Entity:
- Sentient Pants : Attacks the owner's targets and attackers. If a player owns this pair of pants, they can right-click the pants with an empty hand to get the leggings back. The pants will always drop its leggings upon death. The pants' health and max health is determined by the item's durability. If the pants' item(stack) is immune to fire, the pants themselves will be immune to fire. The pants will take the name of the leggings that spawned them.

Configuration:
- Adds an optional datapack to make the Sentience (For The Pants) enchantment a curse
